# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solutions repository! This is my first year participating in Advent of Code, and I'm excited to share my journey through the challenges.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels. It consists of 25 days of coding challenges, with each day offering two related puzzles.

## Repository Structure

Each day's solutions are organized in their own directory:

```
advent-of-code-2024/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aoc.sh  # Unified build script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day01/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part1.cpp
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part2.cpp
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ input.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day02/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Solutions

| Day | Problem                                                   | Solution           | Stars |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| 01  | [Historian Hysteria](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | [Solution](day01/) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  |
| 02  | [Red-Nosed Reports](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)  | [Solution](day02/) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  |
| 03  | [Mull It Over](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3)       | [Solution](day03/) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  |
| 04  | [Ceres Search](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4)       | [Solution](day04/) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê  |

## Running the Solutions

Solutions are written in C++23 and compiled with Clang 19. The repository includes a unified build system that makes it easy to compile and run solutions.

### Using the Build Script

The `aoc` script in the repository root provides a streamlined way to compile and run solutions:

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x aoc

# Run all available solutions
./aoc

# Run both parts of a day
./aoc <day>

# Run a specific part of a day
./aoc <day> <part>

# Examples:
./aoc       # Run all solutions
./aoc 1     # Run both parts of Day 1
./aoc 2 1   # Run only Part 1 of Day 2
```

### Build System Features

- Unified compilation settings across all solutions
- C++23 standard with -O2 optimization
- AddressSanitizer enabled for runtime error detection
- Colored output for better readability
- Automatic input file handling
- Comprehensive error reporting

### Compilation Details

All solutions are compiled with the following flags:

- `-std=c++23`: Latest C++ standard
- `-O2`: Level 2 optimization
- `-fsanitize=address`: AddressSanitizer for memory error detection
- `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`: Comprehensive warning flags

## Personal Goals

- Learn and improve my problem-solving skills
- Experiment with efficient algorithms and data structures
- Complete all 25 days of challenges
- Document my thought process and learnings

## Learnings and Notes

### Day 1

- Learned about sorting-based approach for minimum distance pairing
- Used hash maps for efficient counting in Part 2
- Handled integer overflow cases using long long

### Day 2

- Implemented solution for analyzing nuclear reactor safety reports
- Used vector operations for efficient sequence checking
- Added support for Problem Dampener feature in Part 2

### Day 3

- Implemented pattern matching for parsing corrupted memory data
- Used state management for conditional instruction processing
- Optimized string parsing with early validation checks
- Handled edge cases in multiplication instruction parsing

### Day 4

- Developed grid search algorithm for word pattern matching
- Implemented efficient X-MAS pattern detection using coordinate transformations
- Optimized intersection point detection for crossed patterns
- Handled both forward and reverse pattern matching
