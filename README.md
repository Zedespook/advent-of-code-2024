# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solutions repository! This is my first year participating in Advent of Code, and I'm excited to share my journey through the challenges.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels. It consists of 25 days of coding challenges, with each day offering two related puzzles.

## Repository Structure

Each day's solutions are organized in their own directory:

```

## Running the Solutions

Solutions are written in C++23 and compiled with Clang 19. The repository includes a unified build system that makes it easy to compile and run solutions.

### Using the Build Script

The `aoc` script in the repository root provides a streamlined way to compile and run solutions:

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x aoc

# Run all available solutions
./aoc

# Run both parts of a day
./aoc <day>

# Run a specific part of a day
./aoc <day> <part>

# Examples:
./aoc       # Run all solutions
./aoc 1     # Run both parts of Day 1
./aoc 2 1   # Run only Part 1 of Day 2
```

### Build System Features

- Unified compilation settings across all solutions
- C++23 standard with -O2 optimization
- AddressSanitizer enabled for runtime error detection
- Colored output for better readability
- Automatic input file handling

### Compilation Details

All solutions are compiled with the following flags:
